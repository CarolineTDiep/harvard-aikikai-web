<h2>This page is dedicated to<br>
Sioux Hall Shihan</h2>

<p><u>A message from Chief Instructor Dolita Cathcart:</u></p>

<p>In 2015 Harvard Aikikai lost our beloved Chief Instructor, Sioux Hall Shihan, to a long illness.  She was devoted to her practice of Aikido, and to her many students.  In her final days she asked me to convey this message:</p>


<p><i>To Sioux's Aikido students, she wanted you all to know it was an honor to be your teacher. She loved seeing you progress, grow, and mature into teens and young adults, and in many cases, old adults as well! The kids' classes that Sioux ran gave her so much joy over the years, you all worked so hard and did so well, that no matter how tough a time she was going through, you guys always made her smile. For those older "kids" at Harvard Aikikai, she loved watching how many of you learned to get out of your heads, to trust yourselves, and to grow powerful. Whatever challenges you might have faced, she was delighted to see how year after year you transformed yourselves into smart, strong, and loving friends. Her message to all of you was to keep on practicing and growing. Never stop growing and learning and caring for others.</i></p>

<p>After her Sensei, Kanai Shihan, passed away in 2004 she was determined to instill in her students his principles and teachings.  This set the bar for her students very high, but everyone benefitted from it.</p>

<p>Those who were fortunate enough to be able to learn from and practice with her will always be grateful for what she gave and be reminded to pass along her joy in practice and great love of all aspects of Aikido.</p>
