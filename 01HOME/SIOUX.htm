      <p><b>Sioux Hall<br>
Memorial Remarks<br>
April 25, 2015<br>
By Dolita Cathcart</b></p>

<p>I met Sioux 30 years ago this past December at Peasant Stock Restaurant. Sioux was there with her friend, Ngaio, celebrating winning some lottery money that they promptly spent, and I was their server. When they left, I found a note Sioux had written wondering if we could get together sometime. I had two immediate thoughts: the first was how brave she was to leave a note like this! The second thought was, that was how my father met my mother! Well, it was too late to call that evening, so I called the following afternoon. I wanted her to know that I was leaving for Washington, DC, to do some research for half a year and didn't want her to feel too embarrassed and not return to the restaurant. We spoke on the phone for five hours, then she picked me up in her old yellow Volkswagen Beetle and we went to Modern Times for way too much coffee, and then out dancing. My first thought the next day was, Wow! What a beautiful force of nature.</p>

<p>While away, we wrote to each other 3 to 4 times a day. After opening the first letter from Sioux, I realized I had to open all of the subsequent letters over newspapers because each was filled with glitter, pressed flowers, and other tiny items hard to vacuum! Each letter was a gift of love. We wrote about our lives, travails, successes and failures. We told each other our biographies with an honesty that was stunning at the time; and in those letters, I came to learn just how brave Sioux was, and how her bravery came from the deepest well of love a person can possess.</p>

<p>Sioux exhibited bravery at an early age because of the trauma she suffered at the hands of an abusive father. She did not want to continue to be his victim, so she started to run away from home. When found, the authorities returned Sioux to suffer even more violence. But she kept on running and hitchhiking further and further away until Massachusetts made her a ward of the courts. During her many escapes, hippies would often pick her up and take her to a commune for a while. Those communes were the few times she felt safe, cared for and loved. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for her experiences as a ward of the court and as a foster child. But throughout these travails, Sioux still did her homework every night, knowing even then that an education would, eventually, set her free. She also became and remained an unapologetic hippie, honoring those anonymous young adults who took her in and gave her a safe harbor, at least for a little while.</p>

<p>Those early experiences resulted in Sioux making a vow to never abuse a child of her own. She vowed to protect her child; to enrich her child's experiences and to love that child with her entire being. This was all well before Aiden, Sioux's son, was conceived. It was a vow she took as a child, and one she honored her entire life. Sioux also vowed to continue her education, the means to a better future. She worked, put herself through college, and discovered Aikido in those years.</p>

<p>Aikido was a perfect martial art for Sioux to study and master. Sioux was a Sixth Dan and a Shihan, a master teacher, a rare honor for women in Aikido. Aikido's principle of blending with an attack and redirecting it fit Sioux's desire to be able to defend herself from violence with love and in harmony with both the attacker and the environment. In defending herself, she did not want to become the attacker in spirit; she wanted to transform the attacker. Sioux studied Aikido not only to defend herself, nor just as a reaction to the trauma she had suffered; Sioux studied Aikido so she could protect children, animals and adults, pretty much in that order! In Aikido, Sioux protected the women. The men of Aikido were pretty much men of their generation so women were not taken too seriously in the earlier years. Sioux changed that by always practicing at the highest levels, particularly with Mark Cavanaugh, by training and mentoring women and men on their way up through the ranks, by modeling the very principles of Aikido in her every day life, not just in the dojo; and by never giving up or giving in. When Kanai Sensei refused to accept Sioux into his iaido class, a sword drawing class, Sioux showed up for each class anyway, she sat at the door, and brought Sensei a cup of coffee every time until he finally relented, months later. Whether it was when she would wear a hakama, or protecting a new woman student from some jerky guy with wandering hands, Sioux stood up for equality, justice, and transformation.</p>

<p>Sioux was transformed as well by Aikido. No longer weak, no longer vulnerable, a champion of the weak, a model for others to follow; she was no longer that skinny vulnerable kid with brilliant red hair, she became a force of nature, a defender of children, and a great friend to so many. I'm certain many are here today who count Sioux as their best friend, as I do as well. That Sioux had so many best friends should not make us think that those numbers dilute our personal relationship to Sioux. Her capacity for love was great and is a testament to her boundless love, power, and charisma.</p>

<p>The week prior to Sioux's passing she learned the cancer had spread. We all thought she would have enough time to say goodbye to her family and friends, in particular those who did not have a chance to see her while Sioux was undergoing treatment. We spoke earlier in her last week about putting a schedule together so that everyone could say his or her goodbyes, and we started to work on a statement that she wanted me to send to everyone. But by the end of the week she was gone. But this is what she wanted all of you to know:</p>

<p>To Sioux's care team: Thank you. She felt so loved by all of you. The time you took out of your own busy lives to sit with her, take her to appointments, and organizing the team to insure Sioux was not alone for a single day, meant so much to her. But thanks also go to those who volunteered to help keep the house clean, water the garden, cook meals for Aiden, and just generally help where needed, and all of the others who sent Sioux books, magazines, DVDs and were ready to help at a moments notice. She wanted all of you to know that she was so thankful for all you that you did and for all that you were willing to do.</p>

<p>To Sioux's many friends, young and old, who did not have a chance to see her before she passed, she wanted to apologize to you for not seeing you earlier and hoped that you would understand. You know how much Sioux loved you, you were all so important to her life. She wanted to thank you for your love, your help and assistance over the years, and hoped that you would continue to love and help others, and to be more than the sum of your life and experiences. Resilience, Sioux found, is built on helping others. The more we help others, the stronger we become, and the better able we are to deal with our own demons. So, dear friends of Sioux, play it forward.</p>

<p>To Sioux's Aikido students, she wanted you all to know it was an honor to be your teacher. She loved seeing you progress, grow, and mature into teens and young adults, and in many cases, old adults as well! Muso's kid classes that Sioux ran with Amy Kipp gave her so much joy over the years, you all worked so hard and did so well, that no matter how tough a time she was going through, you guys always made her smile. For those older “kids” at Harvard Aikikai, she loved watching how many of you learned to get out of your heads, to trust yourselves, and to grow powerful. Whatever challenges you might have faced, she was delighted to see how year after year you transformed yourselves into smart, strong, and loving friends. Her message to all of you was to keep on practicing and growing. Never stop growing and learning and caring for others.</p>

<p>To Sioux's family: You guys know how much you meant to Sioux. In your sister's twenties, some of you stayed with Sioux through high school and until you left for college. She wanted you to see how smart and talented you all were, how furthering your education would offer more opportunities and choices in life. She was there for you when the times were rough, and celebrated the good times with you as well. She was always ready with an ear and sage advice. Advise that always seemed to work! She wanted for all of you to realize that you could overcome your personal demons, and that your past was not a prelude to your future. She believed you could all be happy and fulfilled. So Hall family, your charge is to continue to be those things for yourself and for your family and friends. Be there for each other, yes mourn the loss of Sioux, but embrace the lesson that Sioux modeled daily: be boundless in your love, be patient with one another, encourage those who stumble while holding out your hand to help, and for all of us who will stumble, reach back, stand up, and carry on.</p>

<p>To Sioux's Nieces and Nephews: Some of you did not have a chance to say good-bye to your Aunt Sioux, and she was very sorry that she ran out of time. Please do not blame your parents for not bringing you earlier. Your Aunt Sioux did not want you to remember her as being sick; she wanted you to remember her as the Aunty with great gifts, a fun house, and a loving heart. Aunt Sioux will always be the little angel on your shoulder in her Aikido gi and hakama telling you that you are loved, that you are special, and that you are strong. She wanted to let you know that when she was little, she did not have many friends, and that sometimes she was in five different schools in one year. She wanted you to know that she was the kid in school who stuck out, who did not have much, whose clothing needed mending, and who was different. She wanted you to be kind to those kids in school who are different, who may not have as much as you have, because she was that kid. Your Aunt Sioux wanted you to be kind to others, befriend those without friends, and give your parents a big hug. Your Aunt Sioux loved you.</p>

<p>To Linda: I know Sioux told you, but she wanted me to tell you again, she so loved you and cared for you. She was so thankful for all of the ways you helped her and Aiden with your love, and friendship. But you also made it possible for Sioux to care for Aiden in the way she wanted to care for him. You provided monetary support, made home cooked meals, and most importantly, cared for Aiden. Sioux would have had to make other choices in life had you not been there for her over the many decades you two were friends. She was always appreciative of everything you did for her and Aiden.</p>

<p>To Don, Aiden's father: Don, you gave Sioux the only real gift she ever wanted, a child, a son whose smile was dazzling and whose habits of mind made us all smile. You were one of Sioux's buddies in Aikido along with dear friend, Bonnie Vesey, and the nicest man she had ever met. That she asked you to be Aiden's dad is a testament to the trust she held in you. That you were there for Sioux's final hours, as difficult as that must have been for you, your calm demeanor and take charge personality I know was a comfort to her, as were your other visits during the course of her illness. She leaves you her most precious gift, Aiden, and trusted that you would help guide Aiden through his adulthood. She loved you and thanked you for all you did.</p>

<p>To Aiden: Your mom was so proud of you the day you graduated from college, just nearly a year ago today. Your first week of post grad work was the same week your mom learned of her diagnosis. She didn't want you to know. She wanted you to move into your own apartment, be successful at work, and have fun; she feared knowledge of her condition would make you want to stay home and delay your adventure into your adult life. Her fervent desire as you were growing up was to successfully help launch you into this next chapter in your life, and was so proud to see that was actually happening. She absolutely loved the man you were becoming.</p>

<p>Well, Aiden, you've been peeling off the bubble wrap of your mom's care for a few years now and will have to deal with things many in your cohort would not have to face for some time, and you have been doing a great job under impossible conditions. But know you are not alone. You know your mom wanted to raise you so that you would not know fear the way she knew fear, that you would know how loved you were and how so very special you were to her. She wanted you for her entire life, and your birth, difficult as it was, was her happiest day. She surrounded you with adults who were each special in their own way. Your mom knew she did not have all of the answers, and she knew that her early years, no matter how hard she struggle to keep her head up and move forward, nonetheless affected the decisions she made. All of Sioux's friends, each so very different from the next, people who may not have known one another except for Sioux, each of these people offered other ways to live and to be in the world; each had their own special strength and talent to share. All of them came to love you, and all of us are here to tell you we are here for you, we love you, we care for you, and we will help you in anyway. Sioux's greatest sadness was that she would not be physically here to see you grow, mature, and have your own family. But through your memories of your mom, through your large extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins and grandmother, through your dad and your mom's many friends, you are not alone. Sioux deliberately constructed her life this way and leaves this for you. We all have a little of your mom in us, and we offer that bit, and ourselves to you.</p>

<p>Like many of you, Sioux was my best friend, and her loss is a profound one. But it is time to say good-bye and thank you, Sioux. You gave me so much, taught me so much, and I hope I was there for you as well. I promise to always love Aiden and have him in my life. I promise to honor your friendships and example, and to continue your spirit in Aikido until I can't do it anymore. Thank you for thirty great, interesting, and wild years. Thank you for teaching me what it means to be a friend. Thank you and good-bye. I love you.</p>
