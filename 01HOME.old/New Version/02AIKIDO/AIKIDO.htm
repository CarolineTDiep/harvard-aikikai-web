        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">Aikido is a modern martial art with roots that 
          stretch far back into Japan's history. The creator of Aikido, Morihei 
          Ueshiba (1883-1969), synthesized the art out of the knowledge he had 
          acquired from his extensive practice of a wide variety of Japanese martial 
          arts, such as the Tenjin Shinyo-ryu, Yagyu-ryu, and (most importantly) 
          Daito-ryu schools of jujitsu, as well as various systems of combat using 
          the sword, staff, and spear. Ueshiba, who is usually referred to as 
          &quot;kaiso&quot; (&quot;The Founder&quot;) or &quot;o-sensei&quot; 
          (&quot;Great Teacher&quot;) by those who practice Aikido, continued 
          to develop and rationalize his art over the course of his life, creating 
          a system that is accessible to beginners but still a continual source 
          of insight for those with many years of training behind them. </font> 
        </p>
      </div>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Garamond"> As with other martial arts, and 
        the various forms of jujitsu in particular, on a purely mechanical level 
        Aikido utilizes a wide range of joint locks and pins in subduing one's 
        opponent. Aikido consists of much more than just these, however: timing, 
        balance, and breathing are all crucial elements in the practice of the 
        art and the execution of any given technique. Rather than meeting force 
        with force head on, through proper posture, balance, motion, and breathing, 
        one learns to blend one's force with that of the would-be attacker, thereby 
        taking control of the force and direction of the attack and making these 
        a part of the unfolding technique. This idea of blending rather than clashing, 
        of moving with the attacker rather than against him or her, lies at the 
        very heart of the art, and is apparent even in its name - &quot;Aikido&quot; 
        - which can be translated quite literally as the &quot;Way of bringing 
        together Ki.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Garamond"> This emphasis on blending rather 
        than confrontation is also reflected in the way one learns and practices 
        Aikido. Although it is possible to speak of an &quot;attacker&quot; and 
        a &quot;defender&quot; in regard to any given technique, in the dojo, 
        or training hall, there are only partners, rather than &quot;combatants&quot; 
        or &quot;competitors.&quot; In other words, people take turns in the roles 
        of &quot;attacker,&quot; or uke - the person who delivers a specified 
        form of attack (such as a punch, strike, or hold) - and &quot;defender,&quot; 
        or nage - who absorbs this attack in order to execute the particular technique 
        being practiced. Although one partner might deliver an attack with a great 
        deal of force, and the other might in turn respond with an equally powerful 
        and effective execution of the technique, it is never a competition: at 
        any given moment, each partner understands his or her role in practicing 
        the technique at hand. Such a cooperative spirit in training allows beginners 
        to learn the proper movements, posture, and breathing involved in Aikido, 
        without becoming caught up in trying to &quot;win&quot; or &quot;beat&quot; 
        their partner. Indeed, approaching practice as a kind of competition not 
        only impedes one's progress in learning Aikido, but can also be dangerous, 
        since a properly executed technique can deliver a tremendous amount of 
        force to a very localized area, resulting in serious injury for someone 
        who tries to resist. Avoiding competition in practice also creates a friendly, 
        welcoming atmosphere in which people of different genders, sizes, ages, 
        and levels of physical strength can come together to learn Aikido and 
        help each other along the path to a greater understanding of its principles.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Garamond"> Although the unarmed, or taijutsu, 
        techniques are by far the most frequently practiced in Aikido, learning 
        to use the sword (ken) and staff (jo) is also of pivotal importance in 
        one's training. O-sensei practiced these disciplines extensively and incorporated 
        the posture and movements of them into Aikido in such a way that, through 
        practicing with the sword or staff, one can gain fuller insight into the 
        way one's body should move in the taijutsu techniques, and vice versa. 
        Here too, partners practice using these weapons in a cooperative frame 
        of mind, with each taking turns at being the attacker or defender in a 
        series of paired exercises that stress important aspects of posture, timing, 
        breathing, and harmonious blending of motion. While generally harder to 
        understand than the taijutsu techniques, once one begins to grasp the 
        inner logic of how these weapons are used and the way the body moves in 
        the process of properly wielding a sword or staff, weapons training can 
        become one of the most intriguing and rewarding aspects of one's practice.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Garamond"> The health benefits of Aikido 
        are numerous. As a martial art that is not based on competition and does 
        not require physical training to increase one's strength or stamina, one 
        need not be in optimal physical condition to begin learning Aikido. Since 
        partners cooperate rather than compete in practice, one can work through 
        the technique being practiced at one's own desired pace, using whatever 
        speed and strength one is comfortable with at one's particular level of 
        physical condition and knowledge of Aikido. This does not mean, of course, 
        that Aikido practice is necessarily slow or soft. Once one becomes familiar 
        with the kinds of joint locks, throws, and pins involved, and learns to 
        move and fall in response to these in a way that will prevent serious 
        injury, practice between such partners can become fast and powerful, providing 
        quite an aerobic workout for both. In addition, Aikido's emphasis on proper 
        breathing, balance, and posture results in the steady improvement of all 
        of these in one's daily life, and provides a sense of being more &quot;charged&quot; 
        with energy and in tune with one's body.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Garamond"> It is difficult to offer a general 
        description of the psychological benefits to be gained through practicing 
        Aikido, since these are no doubt as numerous and varied as the personalities 
        of those practicing it. More has been written on this aspect of Aikido, 
        both in Japan and abroad, than on any other aspect of the martial art. 
        While this is no place to delve into a discussion of the debates involved, 
        one may say that a great deal of popular writing on Aikido tends to put 
        a psychological spin on ideas that were for the Founder part of a profoundly 
        esoteric religious worldview, based on his deep faith in Shinto and the 
        related religion of Omotokyo. In any case, those who practice Aikido are 
        not called upon to embrace the tenets of any particular religion, although 
        many people become almost &quot;religious&quot; about working out at the 
        dojo as often as they can. On the most mundane level, perhaps, the level 
        of concentration that a person gradually learns to bring to their practice 
        of Aikido techniques, focusing on various aspects of their own bodies 
        and movements, as well as those of their partner, has the effect of increasing 
        one's bodily awareness and power of concentration. The lack of competition 
        in the dojo, as well as the emphasis on blending with an attack rather 
        than meeting force with force, gradually helps one adopt a less antagonistic 
        attitude towards situations of conflict, whether physical or emotional. 
        Furthermore, the sense of well-being and contentment one finds in working 
        out with close friends in a lively dojo is certainly another of the many 
        sublime psychological benefits of practicing Aikido. </font></p>
